## 🌟 Why KittyCoder?

If I tell you that **Copilot exceeded its quota again**, would you believe it? 🙃  
Meanwhile, I recharged **¥10** on DeepSeek half a year ago… and I still have **¥9.6** left.

KittyCoder was created to provide a development assistant that is:

- More affordable  
- More stable  
- More friendly for users in mainland China

## 💡 Key Advantages

1. **Extremely cost-effective** — DeepSeek is inexpensive, fast, and easy to pay for  
2. **Copilot-like experience** — Type `@cat` to chat just like with Copilot  
3. **Instant code generation** — Type `@cat` anywhere in the editor to get code generated based on the current file’s language  
4. **Safe and non-intrusive** — KittyCoder never modifies your code directly; it only provides suggestions

Example:

```typescript
// Copy text to clipboard @cat
