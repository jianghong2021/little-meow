# Little Meow Coding Assistant
A simple and convenient AI programming assistant.

This extension uses the **official DeepSeek API**.  
You need to apply for an API **token** from DeepSeek’s website and enter it in the extension settings.

### Motivation
If I told you my **Copilot** usage quota ran out *again*, would you believe it?  
Meanwhile, I topped up ¥10 on DeepSeek half a year ago, and there is still ¥9.6 left.

### Advantages
1. Extremely cost-effective and friendly for users in China, while paying for Copilot is often difficult.
2. If you're used to Copilot, you can use **@Mycat**, which keeps the Copilot-style interface.

### Features
1. [x] Automatically reads the visible code snippet in the current editor
2. [x] Generates highlighted code with one-click copy
3. [x] Built-in **Copilot-style** chat participant — interact simply by mentioning **@Mycat**
4. [ ] Editor interaction for quick code modification
5. [ ] Terminal interaction to automatically read errors and adjust code based on logs
